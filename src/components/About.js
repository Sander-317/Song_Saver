        I thought I was gonna do this assignment in redux in no time but
        unfortunately I found out that redux was still magic to me. So I decided
        I was gonna do it in state because I started to get it in the last
        assignment. I started by making all the components to get a rough
        overview of all the things I needed to do. Then I started tackling them
        one by one. And as an extra i wanted to incorporate some custom font and
        fontawesome logos that you can click on and something happens and a star
        rating system. Then i came across a model zo i wanted one of those to. I
        keep Thinking of stuff to add but time is getting an issue.

        On my last assignment I got the comment that I didn't use git commit
        enough so I used it a lot i was wondering if I may have committed a
        little too much.

        Kind regards, Sander
